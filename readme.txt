Added Multilabel datalayer. It includes a syncrhonous and asynchronous datalayer.

The layer is integrated in the base model. 

- It may break; we need to run it for some hours to be sure nothing happens.
- Multilabel loss will give us a loss... nothing else. If we want to check accuracies we will need custom layers. No worries; no backprop required!

The scripts to prepare the dataset are ready. They are also prepared to load videos (proper split in train and test). Still no recurrent or anything like that. No clue about how to do that.
